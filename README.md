# MERN-Finance-Tracker ðŸš€ðŸš€

Overview:

Here I have created my very own personal finance tracker with authentication and database integration. 
I have implemented the use of MERN stack which consist of MongoDB, Express, React and Node JS 
to help me create this finance app in this project. This application starts off ata the authentication 
page where users can sign up or sign in using the Clerk API. Once signed in, you will be taken to the 
dashboard where you will be able to add expenses or any data of such to your record.

This is the landing page you will be presented with once you have entered the website and
it will give you the option to sign in or sign up if you don't already have an account.
