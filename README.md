🚀MERN-Finance-Tracker🚀

Overview:

Here I have created my very own personal finance tracker with authentication and database integration. 
I have implemented the use of MERN stack which consist of MongoDB, Express, React and Node JS 
to help me create this finance app in this project. This application starts off ata the authentication 
page where users can sign up or sign in using the Clerk API. Once signed in, you will be taken to the 
dashboard where you will be able to add expenses or any data of such to your record. 


1:
This is the landing page you will be presented with once you have entered the website and
it will give you the option to sign in or sign up if you don't already have an account.

2:
Once you have signed up and created an account, you will be presented with 
"Welcome User! Here are your finances". Here you will be able to add any expenses or income data to 
your own personal finance tracker.

3:
If some reason you would like to delete any records, you can simply press the delete button
which will show at the end of the record and it will be deleted off your account.

CLERK: Clerk has been implemented to manage users of this app, giving me the features to impersonate user,
set a new password for the user, ban user and delete user account but the user will be given the option 
to delete their account in settings once they are in the app (located beside dashboard on the top right).

MongoDB: MongoDB has been implemented to manage the data uploaded to a users account, for instance if they
have added any records, it will show the data in MongoDB and it will give me options to edit, copy, clone or
remove their data
